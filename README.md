# 🌿 Cypress Beginner Guide

A quick and beginner-friendly guide to get started with **Cypress** for testing web applications.

---

## 🌀 1. What is Cypress?

Cypress is a **JavaScript-based test automation tool** used to test web applications.

You can write tests that:

- 🌐 Visit web pages  
- ✍️ Click buttons, fill forms  
- ✅ Check if something is visible  
- 🔐 And make sure your app works as expected  

It’s mainly used for **End-to-End (E2E)** testing, but also supports **integration** and **component** testing.

## 🔥 2. Why Cypress?

- 💡 Easy to learn (if you know JavaScript)  
- ⚡ Fast & Real-time reloads  
- 🧪 Interactive GUI (you see what’s happening!)  
- 📦 Everything runs in the browser (no WebDriver needed)  
- 🧼 Clean syntax (`cy.get().click()`)

---

## 📦 3. How to Install Cypress

Run this in your project folder (Node.js required):

```bash
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

Then open Cypress GUI:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

## 📁 4. Cypress Folder Structure

Once Cypress is opened, it creates a cypress/ folder with:

- e2e/: where your test files go (*.cy.js)

- fixtures/: test data (JSON)

- support/: reusable commands

- cypress.config.js: configuration settings

---

## 🧪 5. Writing Your First Test

- Inside cypress/e2e/sample.cy.js, try this:

```js
describe('My First Test', () => {
  it('visits the site', () => {
    cy.visit('https://example.com')
    cy.contains('More information').click()
  })
})

```
